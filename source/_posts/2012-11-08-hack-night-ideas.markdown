So just some things running around inside my head:

### PSN/XBox Live like Trophies/Achievements for Github Users
* HTML5 Browser Notifications for alerts
* Leaderboards. Global and for github watched/twitter followed
* Twitter Integration for taunting people
>"@mikedanko just cruised past you by unlocking the #{@trophy.name} achievement. DOMINATING!"

... and announcements
>"I just got a gold trophy for a scandalous commit message"

* Recommendable! Allows for netflix-like repo recommendations and shows you users most like yourself.
* The above feature could make this a POWERFUL recruiting tool. Is this Klout for Github?

### Conclave Related
* Comparing [Conclave](http://conclaveapp.herokuapp.com) to [Rabel](http://rabelapp.com/). I've got the two setup. Both interesting. I do not understand moonspeak, some things hard to understand.
* We need some view cleanup. Weird partials, responsive layout is broken. Run through the site with Skitch and haze it sorority style?
* Have had some features I'd like to see from actual use: Some sort of "credits page". Also how far off your deployment is from origin/master and letting admins know there's an update via a flash (sort of like wordpress)
* Simplify deployment with rake tasks?
* Bug squashing challenge?
* Emoji? This is sort of difficult, I took a personal stab at this, but all the other conditional display stuff stomps all over it.
